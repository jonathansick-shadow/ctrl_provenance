    a container for collecting and bring together provideres and
    consumers of provenance information in order to record provenance
    for a production run.

    This class is motivated by the need (in the ctrl_orca package) to
    have an abstract interface for recording provenance that hides the
    details of how to connect to the consumer of provenance and the
    specific data needed to do so.

    This class is intended to be used via a visitor pattern:  this
    container is passed to any class interested in receiving provenance
    information.  That class passes in an encapsulation of how to
    record the provenance as a ProvenanceRecorder instance and/or a 
    command line template (for recording on a remote platform).
